# 4. Checking compatibility

1. launch RVM. Ignore any updates it claimed it knew. You may not have the red shaded part, that's normal.
![launch rvm](https://github.com/SodaWithoutSparkles/ReVanced-troubleshooting-guide/blob/main/screenshots/040-first_launch_manager.jpg?raw=true)
2. Go to the settings tab and scroll down until you find "About"
![check about](https://github.com/SodaWithoutSparkles/ReVanced-troubleshooting-guide/blob/main/screenshots/050-check_about.jpg?raw=true)
3. Check that `Arch` had at least 1 entry that looks like `arm64-v8a`
4. If you only got something that said `armv7` or lower, you cannot patch it on your phone. Please patch it on another device or your PC.
5. If you got `armv8` or higher, you are probably fine
6. Check that your Android version is at least 8
7. If you only got something that said `7` or lower, you cannot patch it on your phone. Please patch it on another device or your PC.
8. If you made it here, you can probably patch on your phone with ReVanced manager
