# 6. Select patches

The manager now automatically select patches for you. Go to the next section. 

!!!danger
Changing the default patches may break things. It is NOT recommended for new users to change the default selection.
!!!

!!!
If you are repatching, you may want to follow until step 2 to check for new and updated patches. 
Click the "Default" button but **DON'T** disable the patches yourself unless you know absolutely what you are doing
!!!

==- I want to change the default selection

!!!danger
Do NOT change the default patches unless you know what you are doing, especially:
- `Vanced MicroG Support`
- `Client Spoof`
!!!
3. You can scroll around and disable some patches. BUT don't disable any which you don't know the purpose of.
4. DO NOT ENABLE THE FOLLOWING PATCHES
    - Change package name
    - Enable Android debugging
    - Export all activities
    - Predictive back gesture
    - Remove screenshot restriction
    - Spoof wifi connections
5. You can disable the following patches safely. I have tested them:
    - Disable auto captions
    - Hide player overlay
    - Hide seekbar
    - Hide timestamp
    - Wide search bar

6. When you have finished, click "Done" on the bottom right
