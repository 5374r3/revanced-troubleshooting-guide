==- If you want to change the default patches
!!!danger
Do NOT change the default patches unless you know what you are doing, especially:
- `Vanced MicroG Support`
- `Client Spoof`
!!!
3. You can scroll around and disable some patches. BUT don't disable any which you don't know the purpose of.
4. DO NOT ENABLE THE FOLLOWING PATCHES
    - Change package name
    - Enable Android debugging
    - Export all activities
    - Predictive back gesture
    - Remove screenshot restriction
    - Spoof wifi connections
5. You can disable the following patches safely. I have tested them:
    - Disable auto captions
    - Hide player overlay
    - Hide seekbar
    - Hide timestamp
    - Wide search bar
