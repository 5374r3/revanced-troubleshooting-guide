# 2. Checking versions

We are going to start patching now, but first we need to check supported version of YouTube.

The latest supported YT version is:

```
18.32.39
```

[![It is 18.32.39](https://img.shields.io/badge/Latest%20Supported%20Version-18.32.39-ff0000?style=for-the-badge&logo=youtube)](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/youtube/youtube-18-32-39-release/youtube-18-32-39-android-apk-download/)

as of 2023-09-18T06:35 UTC. Remember that, as we will use it very soon.

==- How to check manually
1. Go to the official [ReVanced patches website](https://revanced.app/patches?pkg=com.google.android.youtube)
2. Select `com.google.android.youtube` if not already selected
3. Find the ðŸŽ¯ icon for the latest supported version of each patch
4. The version you should use is the one that has the lowest version number to ensure maximum compatibility
