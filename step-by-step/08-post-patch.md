# Patching Done!

1. After patching is done, export the patched APK
![export and install](https://github.com/SodaWithoutSparkles/ReVanced-troubleshooting-guide/blob/main/screenshots/150-export_install.jpg?raw=true)
2. Install the patched APK
3. If that does not work, install [SAI](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aefyr.sai) and use that to install instead
4. Keep calm, you don't need to patch again. Just use the exported one in Step 18
