# 3.22. Casting to TV have ads

Casting to TV is different. ReVanced YT does not handle the video stream, it basically tells the TV: go and play that video with this link. So you will need a ad-free YouTube TV client. You can get one [here](https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTubeNext). Note that SmartTubeNext is not developed and not affiliated in any way with the ReVanced team.
