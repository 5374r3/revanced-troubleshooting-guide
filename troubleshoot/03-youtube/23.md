# 3.23. SponsorBlock does not work

SponsorBlock is a community project. There might be no marked sponsors yet because

- The video was too new
- Nobody uploaded/marked any segments

Or it might also be that the SponsorBlock server is down. Wait a few minutes and try again. You can check the status at [here](https://status.sponsor.ajay.app/).

Or, if it does not skip automatically, checkout [3.32](https://sodawithoutsparkles.github.io/revanced-troubleshooting-guide/troubleshoot/03-youtube/32/)
