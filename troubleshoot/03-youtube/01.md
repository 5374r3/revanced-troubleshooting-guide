# 3.1. Unable to open/launch ReVanced YouTube / ReVanced crashing

Probably one of the following: 

- split APK is used to patch
    - Patch again using the full APK
- non-recommended patches/version
    - Patch again with the default/recommended patches/version
    - [Refer to section 2.11 (What patch should I select?)](/troubleshoot/02-manager/11/)
- GmsCore not installed
    - Install it [here](https://github.com/ReVanced/GmsCore/releases/latest)
- You exited ReVanced manager when patching
    - Don't do that. Repatch again.
- There were errors during patching
    - Look at the patching log for `failed`
    - It should be at the first word of the line
    - if so, look at the [patch not applied guide](/troubleshoot/02-manager/16/)
