# 3.1. Unable to open/launch ReVanced youtube / ReVanced crashing

Probably one of the following: 

- split APK is used to patch
    - patch again using the full APK
- non-recommended patches/version
    - patch again with the default/recommended patches/version
- vanced microG not installed
    - install it [here](https://github.com/TeamVanced/VancedMicroG/releases/tag/v0.2.24.220220-220220001)
- You exited ReVanced manager when patching
    - Don't do that. Repatch again.
