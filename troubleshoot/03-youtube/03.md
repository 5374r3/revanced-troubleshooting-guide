# 3.3. App not installed / Installation is blocked / `install_failed_verification_failure`

Probably one of the following reason

- Signature mismatch between existing ReVanced install
    - Delete that existing install
- Google play protect blocked it
    - when the play protect window popped up, click "learn more" and "install anyway"
- You exited ReVanced manager when patching
    - Don't do that. Repatch again.
- Split APK used
    - repatch with non-split APK / full apk
- Artifacts left from previous install / the uninstall was not done cleanly
    - This could only happen if you have installed and uninstalled ReVanced previously
    - You will need to use ADB to fully remove the old install.
    - You can find a guide [here](/03-adb-remove.md)
