# 3.3. App not installed / Installation is blocked / `install_failed_verification_failure`

Probably one of the following reason

- Signature mismatch between existing ReVanced install
    - Delete that existing install
- Google play protect blocked it
    - when the play protect window popped up, click "learn more" and "install anyway"
- You forgot the microG patch
    - Add the `Vanced microG support` patch and try again
- You clicked the wrong apk
    - Double-check that you selected the patched instead of the raw source apk
- There were errors during patching
    - Look at the patching log for `failed`
    - It should be at the first word of the line
    - if so, look at the [patch not applied guide](/troubleshoot/02-manager/16/)
- You exited ReVanced manager when patching
    - Don't do that. Repatch again.
- Split APK used
    - repatch with non-split APK / full apk
- Some unknown reasons
    - We need more information to know what went wrong
    - Install [SAI](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aefyr.sai) on your phone
    - After patching again, click the three-dots menu and export the APK
    - Go into SAI and select the APK you just exported
    - Look at the install failure message and search it on Google
- Artifacts left from previous install / the uninstall was not done cleanly
    - This could only happen if you have installed and uninstalled ReVanced previously
    - You will need to use ADB to fully remove the old install.
    - You can find a guide [here](/03-adb-remove.md)
