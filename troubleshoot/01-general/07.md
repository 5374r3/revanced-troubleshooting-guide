# 1.7. I think I saw a bug

You can post your bug in [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/revancedapp) first to confirm if this is indeed a bug and if anyone else has reported it. Or you can go to the [ReVanced discord](https://discord.gg/revanced) to ask there. The ReVanced development team regularly hangs out there. **DO NOT POST YOUR SUPPORT REQUEST IN CHAT.** Post them in \# general > support instead. Remember to add a tag. You can do so on the bottom left.

After that you can go to the relevant Github issues page to file a bug report.
