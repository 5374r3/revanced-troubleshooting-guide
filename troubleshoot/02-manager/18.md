# 2.18 Regarding ReVanced Extended patches / InvocationTargetExceptions

Using ReVanced Extended patches is the most likely cause for InvocationTargetException.

ReVanced Extended patches which are **nonofficial, unsupported, and discontinued**, you should stop using them.

You can reset to official patch sources by: 

1. Going to manager settings > sources
2. Click the reset icon at top right of the window
3. Click ok 

If that doesn't work solve the issue: 

1. **Clear all of manager's data first**
2. Uninstall manager
3. Download the latest version [here](https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-manager/releases/latest)
