# 2.4. How to export keystore

This is a new feature from version 0.1.0. Go to ReVanced manager > settings > scroll down to import & export > export keystore

If you have an older version (â‰¤0.0.57), you will need to go to `Android/data/app.revanced.manager.flutter/files` and get the keystore there.
