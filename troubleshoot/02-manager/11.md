# 2.11. What patch should I select?

Select the default/recommended ones. When you are in the select patches window, you can click the "default" or "recommended" button on the top. You can review the defaults, but don't exclude patches that you don't know what it means. It is probably needed. Don't worry about functions that you may not like, you can disable them in-app later.

DO NOT SELECT ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PATCHES OR YOU WILL RISK HAVING ISSUES: 

- Change package name
- enable **android** debugging
- export all activities
- Predictive back gesture
- Remove screenshot restriction
- Spoof wifi connections

If you don't know where to start but just want to remove some patches, you can safely remove these. I did not select the following patches: 

- Disable auto captions
- Hide player overlay
- Hide seekbar
- Hide timestamp
- Wide search bar
