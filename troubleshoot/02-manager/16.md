    - manager > settings > _scroll down_ > delete temporary files
    - If this did not work, try using the [generic debug methods](/troubleshoot/04-generic/) on ReVanced manager
    - If it still did not work, re-install ReVanced manager:
        1. Follow [section 2.4](/troubleshoot/02-manager/04/) to export the keystore
        2. Delete existing ReVanced manager, and the ReVanced manager APK file you downloaded before.
        3. Install the latest **stable** version of ReVanced manager [here](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-manager/releases/latest). Do not use the one you downloaded before.
        4. Follow [section 2.5](/troubleshoot/02-manager/05/) to import the keystore
    - If that still did not work, follow the above steps again but DON'T import the keystore
