    - Reset to default patches

    - Read more about that [here](/troubleshoot/18.md)
- "Work profile"
    - ReVanced might not patch if there is a separate profile
    - Solution: Try another phone
    - Thanks bjhiltbrand#4379 for testing
- "Right-to-left" device language used
    - Manager sometimes get confused when a right-to-left language is used
    - Go to phone settings and change the language to English and try again
- ReVanced manager was confused
    - manager > settings > _scroll down_ > delete temporary files
    - If this did not work, try using the [generic debug methods](/troubleshoot/04-generic/) on ReVanced manager
    - If it still did not work, re-install ReVanced manager:
        1. Follow [section 2.4](/troubleshoot/02-manager/04/) to export the keystore
        2. Delete existing ReVanced manager, and the ReVanced manager APK file you downloaded before.
        3. Install the latest **stable** version of ReVanced manager [here](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-manager/releases/latest). Do not use the one you downloaded before.
        4. Follow [section 2.5](/troubleshoot/02-manager/05/) to import the keystore
    - If that still did not work, follow the above steps again but DON'T import the keystore
