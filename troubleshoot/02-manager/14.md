# 2.14. ReVanced manager aborting / exit code 135 / exit code 139 / ARMv7 devices

If you see the text "exit code = 135" or "exit code = 139", then your devices architecture is not supported. 

You are probably using ARMv7. The supported architectures are ARMv8 or above.

Please patch on an another device or on your PC.
