# 2.13. Import patches selection

If you don't know what you should select, or want to use the same set of patches as mine, you can download the patches selection. [!file Patches Selection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SodaWithoutSparkles/revanced-troubleshooting-guide/main/selected_patches_2023-04-30.json).

Then go to ReVanced manager > settings > scroll down to import & export > Import patches selection. Select the downloaded JSON file just now. You now have the same set of patches mine.
