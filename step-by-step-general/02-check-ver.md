# 2. Checking versions

We are going to start patching now, but first we need to check the latest version to patch. You can find the information [here](/05-versions.md).

==- How to check manually
1. Go to the official [ReVanced patches website](https://revanced.app/patches)
2. Select the package name of the app you want to patch. Package name to common name table can be found [here](/05-versions.md).
3. Find the ðŸŽ¯ icon for the latest supported version of each patch
4. The version you should use is the one that has the lowest version number to ensure maximum compatibility
