1. After patching is done, export the patched APK for backup.

![export and install](https://github.com/SodaWithoutSparkles/ReVanced-troubleshooting-guide/blob/main/screenshots/150-export_install.jpg?raw=true)
===
2. Delete the orginal app if you have it installed.
3. Install the patched APK
!!!
Install it in the patching complete screen. You don't need to install the exported one.
!!!
4. If that does not work, install [SAI](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aefyr.sai) and use that to install instead
5. Keep calm, you don't need to patch again. Just use the exported one in Step 1
